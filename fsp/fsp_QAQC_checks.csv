fsp_boutMetadata_pub,,completeness,Verify that the bouts in the expected sample list were collected.,Match the eventID to the expected sampled list for the year,,high,complete_bout,,annual,
fsp_sampleMetadata_pub,,completeness,"Verify that for CFC samples, the sampleIDs match sampleIDs from CFC collection list","Read in CFC sample list, flag records if sampleID is not in list of expected sampleIDs",Important to ensure the correct plots are sampled so that spatial balance of dataset is maintained.,high,complete_cross_table,,both,
fsp_sampleMetadata_pub,,completeness,Verify that n>1 have been collected per eventID,Count the records by sampleID plus eventID,,high,complete.cross.table,,both,
fsp_boutMetadata_pub,,completeness,Verify that all fields with expected data are filled in,Bring in ingest workbook and check that all REQUIRED fields have expected data,,high,complete.within.rec,,both,
fsp_sampleMetadata_pub,,completeness,Verify that all fields with expected data are filled in,Bring in ingest workbook and check that all REQUIRED fields have expected data,,high,complete.within.rec,,both,
fsp_spectralData_pub,,completeness,Verify that all fields with expected data are filled in,Bring in ingest workbook and check that all REQUIRED fields have expected data,,high,complete.within.rec,,both,
fsp_spectralData_pub,,completeness,Check that the samples have data for the correct number of bands.,Verify that there is data for all 426 bands,,high,complete.within.bout,,,
fsp_sampleMetadata_pub,,timeliness,Check that bout was completed within a 31-day window of the cfc collection start date,Identify earliest date for the bout and flag records with dates +30 days,A data entry error for the earliest date within the bout may cause all but the earliest record to be flagged.,high,timely.bout.duration,Maybe custom code,both,
fsp_sampleMetadata_pub,,timeliness,Length of time between the first and last fsp sample,Subtract the last Julian date from the first sample Julian date to make sure it is not longer than 30 days,,high,timely.bout.duration,,both,
fsp_boutMetadata_pub,,plausibility,Identify duplicate records,Primary key is eventID,,high,de-dupe function exists,,both,
fsp_sampleMetadata_pub,,plausibility,Identify duplicate records,Primary key is sampleID,,high,de-dupe function exists,,both,
fsp_spectralData_pub,,plausibility,Identify duplicate records,Primary key is sampleID,,high,de-dupe function exists,,both,
fsp_spectralData_pub,,plausibility,Identify unrealistic values of reflectance,Verify that all values are within the range 0.0 - 1.0,,high,custom,,both,
fsp_spectralData_pub,,plausibility,Identify unrealistic values of wavelengths,Verify that all values are within the range 0 - 3000,,high,custom,,both,
fsp_spectralData_pub,,plausibility,Verify that spectra ratios are valid,Verify that the reflectance values at wavelength 1000 are greater than the reflectance values at wavelength 500,Vegetation has a sharp increase around 700-800 wavelengths. This would be captured by checking the reflectance values slightly larger and smaller wavelengths.,future (high),,,both,
fsp_spectralData_pub,,plausibility,Verify that spectra ratios are valid,Compare spectra ratios for wavelength 1000 and wavelength 500 in different biomes or NLCD class types,Look at plausible_percentile_range_check,future (medium),,,both,
