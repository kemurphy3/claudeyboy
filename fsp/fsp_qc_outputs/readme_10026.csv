"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10026.001"
"Name: Plant foliar traits"
"Description: Traits of sun-lit canopy plants reported at the level of the individual (woody plants) or community (herbaceous plants)."
"NEON Science Team Supplier: Terrestrial Observation System"
"Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's measurement of foliar traits in sun lit, georeferenced vegetation samples. Trait measurements include leaf mass per area, leaf water content, chlorophyll, carbon and nitrogen concentrations and stable isotopes, major and minor elements, and ‘lignin’ as quantified by the acid detergent method. Whenever possible, foliar data are collected in conjunction with overflights of the NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP), and starting in 2020 polygon shapefiles are provided to link sampled crowns to airborne imagery. For additional details, see the user guide, protocols, and science design listed in the Documentation section below. Queries for this data product will return field collection data, physical and chemical measurements, and crown polygons (where available) on a per sample basis. Several items are available in the expanded data package, including summary tables of external lab precision and accuracy as well as information on woody sample geolocation."

"Brief Design Description: For sites with predominantly forest/shrubland cover, spatial collection methods differed during early operations (2016‐2018) compared to 2019 and onward. The earlier method involved sampling the top three dominant species present in each of 14 pre‐assigned plots, 4 Tower and 10 Distributed. However, with input from the community, the design shifted away from plots and towards a site‐based approach focused on sampling the full spectrum of canopy biodiversity present at the site. Many of the individuals sampled are monitored in the Vegetation Structure (VST) protocol, and all are georeferenced, using stem offsets (all samples) as well as polygon shapefiles of sampled crowns mapped on top of recent AOP data while in the field (2020 and onward for larger individuals)."
"For grassland sites, the design has remained consistent. Foliage is sampled from 20 plots; all aboveground material in one or two (depending on plot size), randomly selected  0.1 X 2 m clip strips is harvested and homogenized, yielding 20-24 samples per bout. Traits are measured on species mixtures that represent community composition of the clip strip. In sites with both woody and herbaceous cover, a combination of the two sampling approaches is employed."
"Foliar sampling occurs once every five years per site during the period of historic peak greenness. Whenever possible, sampling also occurs close in time to the AOP overflight, and aopCollectDate for each sample is included in the data. Chlorophyll subsamples are immediately frozen after collection, and additional processing of samples, including scans for leaf mass per area and initiation of sample drying for leaf water content and chemical analyses, occurs within 1-5 days of collection. During the same year that foliar traits are measured, other biogeochemical pools and fluxes are as well (e.g., soil chemistry, DP1.10086.001; litter chemistry, DP1.10033.001; root biomass and chemistry, DP1.10067.001) with coincident data at a subset of plots."

"Issue Date: 2024-07-12"
"Issue: Improper leaf scanning D09: Through the 2021 field season, all canopy foliage bouts conducted in sites from Domain 09 Northern Plains used an incorrect scanner to create leaf mass per area images. The canopy foliage sampling protocol specified use of a CanoScan LiDE 120 with specific settings for resolution and brightness. Instead the domain relied on their office Xerox scanner with inconsistent use of the designated settings."
"    Date Range: 2016-06-27 to 2021-06-17"
"    Location(s) Affected: WOOD, DCFS, NOGP"
"Resolution Date: 2024-12-31"
"Resolution: NEON will revise the canopy foliage sampling protocol to further emphasize the importance of using the dedicated scanner with specified settings. Images were available for verification from the WOOD 2016 and NOGP 2020 collection bouts. 17 of the WOOD 2016 images were scanned at low resolution and had blurry edges. These are marked as lmaSampleCondition = 'incorrect scanning procedure, blurry image' and leaf mass per area values likely have reduced accuracy due to this issue. Two of the WOOD 2016 images were scanned at the appropriate resolution and the images are crisp, as such they are not flagged. One WOOD 2016 image was not available to verify, thus it is marked as lmaSampleCondition = 'incorrect scanning procedure, unknown quality impact.' Although the NOGP 2020 images were of variable resolution, upon review all were high quality with crisp edges and thus none are flagged. No images were available to verify from DCFS 2019 or WOOD 2021 bouts, as such they are marked with lmaSampleCondition = 'incorrect scanning procedure, unknown quality impact.' This issue appears in all releases up to and including RELEASE-2024; lmaSampleCondition has been updated in subsequent releases."
"Issue Date: 2024-09-18"
"Issue: C:N chemistry data errors: NEON discovered erroneous values populated in the CNratio field for 84 sunlit plant foliage samples."
"    Date Range: 2019-07-30 to 2019-08-27"
"    Location(s) Affected: NIWO, BONA"
"Resolution Date: 2024-12-31"
"Resolution: Working with the analytical lab, these data errors were corrected and updated values will be available starting in RELEASE-2025. Note that the old, erroneous values will be present in earlier releases. Contact us for information on exactly what values changed for which samples."
"Issue Date: 2024-11-08"
"Issue: Crown polygon projection: Shapefiles that contain crown polygons associated with sunlit foliage samples were originally delivered in the WGS1984 projection (e.g., in decimal degrees). This contrasts with all other NEON remote sensing and spatial data, which are projected on the UTM grid (in meters)."
"    Date Range: 2020-06-30 to 2023-07-18"
"    Location(s) Affected: YELL,DEJU,WREF,MLBS,UKFS,LENO,DSNY,GUAN,JORN,ABBY,BART,STEI,ORNL,SCBI,MOAB,OSBS,SRER,SERC,TEAK,GRSM,ONAQ,TALL,BLAN,TREE,RMNP"
"Resolution Date: 2024-12-31"
"Resolution: For the 2024 sampling season and onward, NEON will only deliver field-delineated crown polygons in the UTM grid. Shapefiles from 2023 have been reprojected to the UTM grid and are available as provisional data. Shapefiles from 2020-2022 have been reprojected and will be available starting in RELEASE-2025. Note that polygons projected in WGS1984 will be present in earlier releases. While the mismatched units compared to other NEON spatial data are inconvenient, there is nothing wrong with these polygons and they are still usable."
"Issue Date: 2024-05-23"
"Issue: Change in chlorophyll QA reporting: The NEON standard operating procedure for foliar pigment analysis requests a quality assurance (QA) sample with known chlorophyll concentration be run alongside samples. Originally the field relativeAccuracyScale in the cfc_chlorophyll table was used to communicate batch-level accuracy of observed vs known for QA samples using numeric bins (A = with 5% of known value, B = within 5-10% of known value, etc). Over time, laboratories working with NEON started to report increased variability in observed chlorophyll contents from purchased QA materials. Declines in accuracy were difficult to attribute to issues with the QA materials themselves compared to issues with the analyses or instruments."
"    Date Range: 2016-06-06 to 2023-07-25"
"    Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2024-07-24"
"Resolution: Instead of reporting the accuracy of chlorophyll QA materials in numeric bins, NEON switched to using the field chlQAMaterialQF to report whether QA criteria were met (e.g., pass or fail). The QA criteria are recorded in the external laboratory standard operating procedure, available in the NEON document library and the data product landing page for Plant Foliar Traits. Additionally, a second type of QA check was added using certified absorbance filters that directly test the performance of the spectrometer. Results are reported in the field absorbanceStandardQF and similarly note if the criteria were met or not, with requirements based upon manufacturer specifications. The field relativeAccuracyScale is no longer populated."
"Issue Date: 2024-11-26"
"Issue: Missing Chemistry SOAP : A set of foliar samples collect at site SOAP in 2024 was not processed for chemistry in a timely manner. Due to a protocol misunderstanding, samples were held in a refrigerator for so long that they were deemed unusable and not sent for analysis of carbon and nitrogen, macro and micro nutrients, or lignin."
"    Date Range: 2024-06-10 to 2024-06-26"
"    Location(s) Affected: SOAP"
"Resolution Date: 2024-07-18"
"Resolution: The field team re-collected foliar tissue from 27 of these trees and shrubs several weeks after the initial collection (and paired AOP remote sensing acquisition) and processed them according to the protocol to provide missed chemistry data. Chlorophyll and carotenoid data are available for both the initial and recollected samples. Within the bounds of analytical uncertainty, the majority of samples did not systematically increase or decrease in pigment content comparing the two collection bouts, perhaps suggesting the June/July period was relatively stable for plant chemical traits. This may provide useful context for researchers interested to pair the SOAP 2024 chemistry data with AOP remote sensing observations. Sample collect dates and AOP collect dates are both recorded in the cfc_fieldData table."
"Issue Date: 2024-09-18"
"Issue: Analytical lab switch: NEON foliar chemistry analyses are conducted by external laboratories. After working with the same lab for many years to analyze carbon and nitrogen concentrations and stable isotope, results of a competitive process resulted in selection of a new lab to conduct these analyses starting in 2024. In order to assess the possible data implications of this lab switch, a set of samples was analyzed by both labs."
"    Date Range: 2016-06-06 to 2023-07-25"
"    Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2024-04-08"
"Resolution: While there were significant differences in observed chemistry values between the two labs according to paired t-tests, the differences were subtle and did not exceed the long-term analytical uncertainty except for delta 15N. For this analyte, values were higher (on the order of 0.5 per mill) when analyzed by the new lab compared to the previous lab; users should interpret the data in this context. For a more detailed look at the lab comparison results, see https://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/CNiso_Lab_Change_2024_Results"
"Issue Date: 2023-05-09"
"Issue: D01 state-level taxa obfuscation: Prior to the 2024 data release, publication of species identifications were obfuscated to a higher taxonomic rank when the taxon was found to be listed as threatened, endangered, or sensitive by any state within the domain. Obfuscating state-listed taxa across an entire domain has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity."
"    Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2023-04-25"
"    Location(s) Affected: D01"
"Resolution Date: 2023-12-31"
"Resolution: To reduce the number of records in which taxonomic identifications are obfuscated in D01, the state-level obfuscation routine has been applied to data using site-level granularity as of 25 April 2023. Previously published data have been reprocessed using the more precise obfuscation routine for the 2024 data release and onward. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites."
"Issue Date: 2023-05-11"
"Issue: Change to Fe and Mn flagging: Foliar major/minor/trace element data are flagged as 'sample value outlier' if they exceed thresholds established using the TRY plant trait database. For Fe and Mn data specifically, NEON had initially included an additional note about ‘soil contamination’ in the outlier flag. Those elements can be high in plant tissue samples that are dirty or dusty, and in the first few years of sample collection, leaf cleaning was not included in the NEON protocol. However, once a tissue cleaning step was added in 2020, high Fe and Mn values are much less likely due to soil contamination."
"    Date Range: 2020-09-09 to 2022-08-10"
"    Location(s) Affected: ABBY, BARR, BART, GRSM, LAJA, ORNL, OSBS, SCBI, SRER, TOOL"
"Resolution Date: 2023-12-31"
"Resolution: The soil contamination part of the outlier flag for Fe and Mn data is no longer used. This has been removed from 2020 and onward records where it formerly existed. The ‘soil contamination’ flag appears in 2020 and/or 2021 data in RELEASE‐2021, RELEASE‐2022, and RELEASE‐2023; it is not present in these data in subsequent releases and provisional data."
"Issue Date: 2023-09-25"
"Issue: Lab summary correction for C-N data: The table `bgc_CNiso_externalSummary` reports the precision and accuracy of carbon and nitrogen concentration and stable isotope measurements of plant and soil samples, based on analysis of secondary reference materials treated as unknowns. The University of Wyoming Stable Isotope Facility had been reporting their summary statistics since 2015 but had mis-interpreted the definitions of some reported uncertainty fields."
"    Date Range: 2015-03-16 to 2023-08-18"
"    Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2023-12-31"
"Resolution: The lab re-generated all summary statistics according to the formulas and definitions expected by NEON and uploaded these corrected values to the NEON data portal. This updated version of the `bgc_CNiso_externalSummary` table is available with download of provisional data and will appear in RELEASE-2024 and onward."
"Issue Date: 2023-11-08"
"Issue: Chlorophyll QA samples invalid: The standard operating procedure for pigment analysis of foliar tissues specifies that a quality assurance (QA) sample with known chlorophyll concentration is to be run alongside samples. This allows for assessment of precision and accuracy of the run. However, the external laboratory that analyzed foliar samples for pigment concentration was unable to procure an appropriate QA material for the 2021, 2022, and 2023 sampling seasons and provided 'relativeAccuracyScale' values in the cfc_chlorophyll table that were not based on a valid assessment of the accuracy of the run."
"    Date Range: 2021-04-23 to 2023-07-25"
"    Location(s) Affected: BART, SCBI, SERC, OSBS, DSNY, GUAN, STEI, KONZ, UKFS, ORNL, GRSM, MLBS, TALL, LENO, WOOD, DCFS, CPER, STER, OAES, YELL, MOAB, JORN, SRER, ONAQ, ABBY, WREF, TEAK, BARR, TOOL, HEAL, DEJU"
"Resolution Date: 2023-12-31"
"Resolution: Entries in the field 'relativeAccuracyScale' in the cfc_chlorophyll table have been set to 'not available' for all impacted records. This change appears in provisional data and will appear in data collected in 2021 starting with RELEASE-2024; it is not present in RELEASE-2023."
"Issue Date: 2023-11-09"
"Issue: SubplotId change: The Base plot subplot naming convention was ambiguous with respect to location and scale, and not well differentiated from the identifiers of the points that spatially define Base plots."
"    Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2023-12-31"
"    Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites"
"Resolution Date: 2023-12-31"
"Resolution: The subplot naming convention is updated across all data products with observations and samples that originate from Base plots. The format consists of the identity of the plot point in the southwest corner of the subplot, the scale or size of the subplot, and, for those subplots smaller than 100 m2, the corner of the 100 m2 subplot in which the smaller subplot is located. For example, ‘21_400’ refers to point 21 in the southwest corner and is 400 m2 (20 m x 20 m), and ‘31_1_1’ is a subplot with point 31 in the southwest corner, is 1 m2, and is in corner 1 of the 100 m2 subplot with point 31 in the southwest corner. See the associated Data Notification for further detail: https://www.neonscience.org/impact/observatory-blog/neon-terrestrial-observation-system-tos-base-plot-subplot-renaming."
"Issue Date: 2023-11-07"
"Issue: MLBS freeze-thawed tissues: During the 2023 foliar sampling bout, nearly half of the samples were stored in a miniature refrigerator following field collection. Due to poor temperature regulation, 18 leaf mass per area subsamples and 19 chemistry subsamples experienced freeze-thaw while in storage in this unit, with the tissues becoming visibly discolored/brown."
"    Date Range: 2023-06-05 to 2023-06-07"
"    Location(s) Affected: MLBS"
"Resolution Date: 2023-12-01"
"Resolution: For seven of the affected individuals, the same trees were resampled within two weeks of initial collection and their individualIDs will repeat in the cfc_fieldData table. For the other individuals, resampling was not possible. All affected records have been flagged with lmaSampleCondition or sampleCondition of 'samples experienced freeze-thaw' in the cfc_LMA or cfc_chemistrySubsampling tables, respectively. Additionally, 'samples experienced freeze-thaw' has been added as a dataQF value in the cfc_lignin, cfc_elements, and cfc_carbonNitrogen tables. Examination of the chemistry data suggests freeze-thaw does tend to impact the trait data, but the direction and magnitude of the effect depends on the trait and species of interest."
"Issue Date: 2023-11-07"
"Issue: Chlorophyll samples stored at -20C: Foliar tissue subsamples destined for pigment analyses (chlorophyll A, chlorophyll B, carotenoids) are flash-frozen in the field using dry ice. Then they are supposed to be held either on dry ice or in ultra-low temp (-80C) freezers until analysis within two weeks of collection. Unfortunately, samples collected in 2022 and the first half of 2023 were not stored in this manner. Upon receipt the analytical lab placed subsamples in a standard -20C freezer instead of holding them at ultracold temps for the period between sample receipt and sample analysis, generally one to seven days."
"    Date Range: 2022-05-10 to 2023-06-09"
"    Location(s) Affected: BART, SCBI, DSNY, GUAN, STEI, KONZ, UKFS, MLBS, ORNL, LENO, STER, OAES, JORN, MOAB, ABBY, BARR, TOOL"
"Resolution Date: 2023-10-05"
"Resolution: The laboratory was made aware of this deviation and they began storing samples at ultracold temperature as per the standard operating procedure. In 2024 a small study (n = 23 samples) was conducted to assess the impact of this storage temperature deviation. Results suggest it had negligible impact on pigment concentrations across the range of hold times (1-7 days) and tissue types (broad and need leaf) tested. For a detailed look at the experimental results, see https://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/FoliarChl_StorageTemp_2024_Results. All affected records are flagged with handlingQF = 'sample held at -20 C instead of ultracold' in the cfc_chlorophyll table, but given the study findings these values should be ok to use for most research purposes."
"Issue Date: 2023-08-08"
"Issue: Missing LMA: A set of foliar samples collect at site ABBY in 2022 was not analyzed for leaf mass per area."
"    Date Range: 2022-07-21 to 2022-08-15"
"    Location(s) Affected: ABBY"
"Resolution Date: 2023-08-03"
"Resolution: The field team re-collected foliar tissue from the 8 woody individuals affected several weeks after the initial foliar collection. These data are flagged as dataQF = lmaOnlySample in the cfc_fieldData table. In order to combine LMA data with the other trait measurements, users will need to match up the LMA data by individualID, as the typical join on sampleID will not allow for connection to other downstream tables."
"Issue Date: 2022-09-15"
"Issue: Toolik Field Station required a quarantine period prior to starting work in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 field seasons to protect all personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This complicated NEON field scheduling logistics, which typically involves repeated travel across the state on short time frames. Consequently, NEON reduced staff traveling to Toolik and was thus unable to complete all planned sampling efforts. Missed data collection events are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical field."
"    Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2022-12-31"

"Resolution: The quarantine policy at Toolik Field Station ended after the 2022 field season."
"Issue Date: 2022-09-15"
"Issue: Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff. Observational data collection was halted during this time. Canceled data collection events are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical field."
"    Date Range: 2022-06-12 to 2022-10-31"
"    Location(s) Affected: YELL"
"Resolution Date: 2022-10-31"
"Resolution: Normal operations resumed on October 31, 2022, when the National Park Service opened a newly constructed road from Gardiner, MT to Mammoth, WY with minimal restrictions.

"Issue Date: 2021-10-29"
"Issue: No 'aopCollectDate': While we aim for coincident ground and airborne data, due to the logistics of the AOP and field sampling schedules, foliar samples are not always collected in a tightly coupled way compared to the AOP overflights. Some plant traits (e.g., pigments, water content) are known to change over the course of the growing season, thus it is helpful for data users to know exactly when samples were collected relative to the remote sensing data in order to decide how to apply foliar data for modeling or validation studies."
"    Date Range: 2016-01-01 to 2021-11-08"
"    Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites sampled during this period."
"Resolution Date: 2022-10-17"
"Resolution: In order to communicate the temporal coupling of the two data streams, a new field called 'aopCollectDate' was added to the `cfc_fieldData` table. This field was added to the data and populated for most previously collected foliar samples in fall 2021. However, for samples associated with field spectral measurements, the edits could not be completed until fall 2022."
"Issue Date: 2022-09-15"
"Issue: Direct URLs to data in large file storage are different in RELEASE-2021 and RELEASE-2022 than in later releases and provisional data."

"    Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2022-04-12"
"Resolution: NEON data storage was migrated to a new system in early 2022. URLs in the downloadFileUrl field begin with https://s3.data.neonscience.org in RELEASE-2021 and RELEASE-2022. In subsequent releases and provisional data, URLs begin with https://storage.neonscience.org . The earlier URLs remain usable and automatically redirect to the current data location. Data contents are identical between the old and new storage system for files with the same name; if data and file names have been updated in subsequent releases, it is due to specific data corrections and quality improvements, not to the storage system."

"    Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2021-12-31"
"Resolution: The primary impact of the pandemic on observational data was reduced data collection. Training procedures and data quality reviews were maintained throughout the pandemic, although some previously in-person training was conducted virtually.  Scheduled measurements and sampling that were not carried out due to COVID-19 or any other causes are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical data field."
"Issue Date: 2021-12-09"
"Issue: State-level taxa obfuscation: Prior to the 2022 data release, publication of species identifications were obfuscated to a higher taxonomic rank when the taxon was found to be listed as threatened, endangered, or sensitive at the state level where the observation was recorded. Obfuscating state-listed taxa has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity."

"    Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2021-12-31"
"Resolution: The state-level obfuscation routine was removed from the data publication process at all locations excluding sites located in D01 and D20. Data have been reprocessed to remove the obfuscation of state-listed taxa. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites and sensitive species remain redacted at National Park sites."

"Issue: Missing foliar chlorophyll: A shipment of chlorophyll samples did not arrive in a timely fashion to the analysis lab and thus could not be analyzed for foliar chlorophyll."
"    Date Range: 2021-09-28 to 2021-10-07"
"    Location(s) Affected: OSBS"
"Resolution Date: 2021-10-27"
"Resolution: The field team re-collected foliar tissue from the 35 samples affected within 10 days of the issue. These are flagged as dataQF = chlorophyllOnlySample in the `cfc_fieldData` table. In order to combine chlorophyll data with the other trait measurements, users will need to match up the chlorophyll data by individualID, as the typical join on sampleID will not allow for connection to other downstream tables."
"Issue Date: 2022-11-15"
"Issue: Crown polygon reference layers: The first year of crown polygon creation, technicians were instructed to always draw field polygons in reference to AOP spectrometer data. However, this layer did not always show the most contrast between neighboring crowns. Moreover, the Canopy Height Model (CHM) layer, which is derived from LiDAR, may show a subtle (up to tens of cm) offset from the spectrometer, but has higher absolute geolocation accuracy."
"    Date Range: 2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31"
"    Location(s) Affected: BLAN, RMNP, TREE, YELL"
"Resolution Date: 2021-01-01"
"Resolution: For the 2021 sampling season and onward, crown polygons are created in reference to the CHM layer whenever possible, although the other layers (spectrometer, camera) may be used when CHM does not provide good contrast between neighboring trees (or the vegetation is too short). Which specific layer was referenced when creating each polygon is listed in the attribute table of the polygon shapefile in a field called ‘mappingLayer.’"
"Issue Date: 2020-12-01"
"Issue: Samples not re-dried: Due to a miscommunication, samples analyzed for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and stable isotopes were not re-dried prior to weighing and analysis at the external lab. While all NEON foliage samples are dried at 65C in the domain labs, they are sometimes then stored in paper bags or coin envelopes for weeks or even months before being ground, transferred to vials, and shipped. During this time they may accumulate moisture, especially in humid areas. Subsequent testing revealed that %C data are likely underestimated by 1.5-2.5% due to this lack of re-drying prior to analysis. As vegetation samples tend to have high %C (20% - 55%), this bias may have only minor impacts on many analyses, but is something for end users to keep in mind. For the other parameters (%N, C:N, d15N, d13C), testing suggests there were no detectable differences between re-dried samples and originals."
"    Date Range: 2016-01-01 to 2020-09-08"
"    Location(s) Affected: All sites with foliar chemistry measurements in this date range, with the exception of GUAN and PUUM whose tissues were re-dried for permitting/quarantine reasons."
"Resolution Date: 2020-11-10"
"Resolution: Affected data have been flagged with dataQF = dryingProtocolError in the `cfc_carbonNitrogen` table. For sample analysis dates starting in November 2020, all carbon-nitrogen samples are re-dried at 65C prior to analysis to drive out any residual moisture and improve data accuracy for % C. Samples collected in 2020 may have been analyzed before or after the change; check dataQF to determine which individual samples are affected."
"Issue Date: 2019-10-15"
"Issue: Foliar element data issue: Possible data quality issues with major, minor, and trace element concentrations (`cfc_elements` table) measured in sunlit plant foliage tissue collected in 2017 and 2018. Data removed on 2019-10-14 due to quality issues with external lab analyses."
"    Date Range: 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31"
"    Location(s) Affected: HARV, SCBI, DSNY, GUAN, STEI, KONZ, UKFS, ORNL, MLBS, TALL, LENO, STER, OAES, MOAB, JORN, SOAP, TOOL, DEJU"
"Resolution Date: 2020-10-29"
"Resolution: Samples re-analyzed using material from the NEON Biorepository and new data were loaded to the data portal on 2020-10-29."
"Issue Date: 2020-10-02"
"Issue: Data products not bundled: Until October 2020, foliar chemistry and stable isotopes were published as separate data products."
"    Date Range: 2016-01-01 to 2020-10-06"
"    Location(s) Affected: All terrestrial sites sampled during this period."
"Resolution Date: 2020-10-06"
"Resolution: In October 2020, data tables for chemistry and isotopes were bundled together in a single data product for improved usability. This applies to all existing and future data."
"Issue Date: 2020-10-08"
"Issue: No sampling impractical: Prior to the 2020 field season, there was no mechanism to indicate when and why a scheduled sampling event may have been missed."
"    Date Range: 2016-01-01 to 2019-12-31"
"    Location(s) Affected: CLBJ, DCFS, DSNY, KONA, KONZ, MOAB, OAES, SJER, STER, TOOL, WOOD"
"Resolution Date: 2020-01-01"
"Resolution: Starting in the 2020 field season, NEON added the field ""samplingImpractical"" to the `cfc_fieldData` table of this data product to assist users in understanding when data for this product are temporarily missing versus permanently unavailable. If field collection of an herbaceous clip strip from an assigned foliar sampling plot or subplot was not possible, samplingImpractical is populated with a value other than 'OK' (e.g., 'location flooded' or 'logistical') and only minimal metadata are recorded. Note that this is only relevant for herbaceous-dominated sites (grasslands). For sites dominated by woody individuals (forests/shrublands), this field is not used since there is no assigned list of plots/subplots."
"Issue Date: 2023-05-11"
"Issue: Foliage cleaning: Prior to 2020, leaf and needles samples were not cleaned following field collection, instead they were dried, ground and sent for processing ‘as is’. After conferring with external advisors and analytical labs, it seemed prudent to clean foliar tissues prior to further processing and analyses. This would help avoid any contaminants on leaf surfaces (like soil or dust) that may influence chemistry values."
"    Date Range: 2016-06-06 to 2019-09-11"
"    Location(s) Affected: BONA, CLBJ, DCFS, DEJU, DELA, DSNY, GRSM, GUAN, HARV, JERC, JORN, KONA, KONZ, LENO, MLBS, MOAB, NIWO, OAES, ORNL, PUUM, SCBI, SERC, SJER, SOAP, STEI, STER, TALL, TOOL, UKFS, UNDE, WOOD, WREF"
"Resolution Date: 2020-01-01"
"Resolution: A foliage cleaning step was added to the field collection protocol for the 2020 season and has been used ever since."
"Issue Date: 2020-10-02"
"Issue: Sampling method change: In forested and shrubland sites, the original protocol was to sample a fixed number of woody individuals (n = 3) from an assigned list of plots (n = 14). In consultation with the Foliar Sampling TWG and other researchers, we decided that the focus should be on capturing the breadth of canopy species diversity across that site, and therefore the sampling strategy needed to shift."
"    Date Range: 2016-01-01 to 2018-12-31"
"    Location(s) Affected: DEJU, GRSM, GUAN, HARV, JORN, LENO, MLBS, ORNL, SCBI, SERC, SOAP, STEI, TALL, UKFS"
"Resolution Date: 2019-01-01"
"Resolution: From 2019 and onward, forest and shrubland sites sample according to a target taxa list, which contains all species present in the canopy (more diverse sites have longer lists and therefore more samples). The most common taxa are sampled with replication, with individuals spread out to capture site gradients, and rare species are sampled where possible. See the Protocol and Data Product User Guide for more details."
"ADDITIONAL INFORMATION"
"----------------------"
"Queries for this data product will return data collected during the date range specified. Each foliage sample has a unique identifier (sampleID) that is expected to appear once in the `cfc_fieldData` table. A record from `cfc_fieldData` is then expected to appear once in `cfc_LMA` and in `cfc_chemistrySubsampling`, with several subsamples created. When crown polygons are created, sampleIDs in the `cfc_fieldData` table are associated with a shapefileID, which appears once in the `cfc_shapefile` table and includes a link to download the crown polygons. Each record from `cfc_chemistrySubsampling` is expected to appear one to several times (if analytical replicates were conducted) in `cfc_chlorophyll`, `cfc_carbonNitrogen`, `cfc_elements` and `cfc_lignin`. There should only be one instance per sampleID x analyticalRepNumber (x co2Trapped entry in the carbon-nitrogen table), but duplicates may exist where protocol and/or data entry aberrations have occurred. Users should check data carefully for anomalies before analyzing data."
