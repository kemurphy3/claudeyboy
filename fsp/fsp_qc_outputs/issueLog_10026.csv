Shapefiles from 2023 have been reprojected to the UTM grid and are available as provisional data. Shapefiles from 2020-2022 have been reprojected and will be available starting in RELEASE-2025. Note that polygons projected in WGS1984 will be present in earlier releases. While the mismatched units compared to other NEON spatial data are inconvenient, there is nothing wrong with these polygons and they are still usable."

Due to a protocol misunderstanding, samples were held in a refrigerator for so long that they were deemed unusable and not sent for analysis of carbon and nitrogen, macro and micro nutrients, or lignin.","The field team re-collected foliar tissue from 27 of these trees and shrubs several weeks after the initial collection (and paired AOP remote sensing acquisition) and processed them according to the protocol to provide missed chemistry data. Chlorophyll and carotenoid data are available for both the initial and recollected samples. Within the bounds of analytical uncertainty, the majority of samples did not systematically increase or decrease in pigment content comparing the two collection bouts, perhaps suggesting the June/July period was relatively stable for plant chemical traits. This may provide useful context for researchers interested to pair the SOAP 2024 chemistry data with AOP remote sensing observations. Sample collect dates and AOP collect dates are both recorded in the cfc_fieldData table."

It is likely that samples were exposed to room temperature methanol for minutes to one hour. This may have caused some degradation of chlorophyll, but the impact is unknown.","Once NEON auditors discovered the issue, the laboratory was instructed to switch to use of chilled methanol, which they did right away. All affected records are flagged with handlingQF = 'sample initially combined with room temperature methanol' in the cfc_chlorophyll table. Users that are concerned about possible chlorophyll degradation may wish to exclude these data from analyses."

However, during the field season of 2024, questions were raised as to whether this was sufficient for creating homogenized subsamples and enabling extraction of all pigment from needles.","Following methods testing, NEON decided to switch the preparation method from hand chop to a grinding mill, with 10-20 seconds grinding time depending on sample type. This results in more homogenized plant foliage and greatly increases the repeatability of analytical replicates. In addition, it seems to slightly increase pigment recovery in needle leaf samples. A new field called 'samplePrepMethod' has been added to the cfc_chlorophyll table to capture this method change. The field is used by the analytical lab going forward, and has been back-filled for all samples where hand chop was used (visible in RELEASE-2026 and onward)."
