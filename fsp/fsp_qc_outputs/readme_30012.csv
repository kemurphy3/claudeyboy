"DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION"
"------------------------"
"ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.30012.001"
"Name: Field spectral data"
"Description: Reflectance of collected sample(s) using leaf clip and hand-held field Spectrometer; opportunistic product, provided when collected."
"NEON Science Team Supplier: Airborne Observation Platform"
"Abstract: NEON AOP Field Spectral Data are collected using a field-spectrometer and leaf clip to observe leaf-level reflectance spectra within two-weeks of AOP overpass. Some field spectral observations will be collected from samples that are also used to develop the foliar chemistry data product. The Field Spectral Data are collected and distributed as an opportunistic activity and as such are not collected for every flight or site. Typical collection rates will be one or two sites annually."
"Latency: Field spectral data will be available 90 days after the final collection day at a site. Field spectra legacy data (those collected in 2013 through 2016) currently has no availability, and will be completely available by April of 2021."
"Brief Design Description: NEON AOP Field Spectral Data are collected using a field-spectrometer and leaf clip to observe leaf-level reflectance spectra within two-weeks of AOP overpass. Some field spectral observations will be collected from samples that are also used to develop the foliar chemistry data product. The Field Spectral Data are collected and distributed as an opportunistic activity and as such are not collected for every flight or site. Typical collection rates will be one or two sites annually."
"Brief Study Area Description: All NEON terrestrial sites are candidates for sampling; sampling is opportunistic."
"Sensor(s): ASD field spectrometer"

"Domain: D04"
"DATA PACKAGE CONTENTS"

"Expanded download package definition: The expanded package includes the basic package as well as field spectral measurements observed with the field spectrometer."
"FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS"
"-----------------------"
"NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions"
"for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via"
"NEON's data portal or API. Please visit https://www.neonscience.org/data-formats-conventions for a full description"
"of the naming conventions."
"ISSUE LOG"
"----------"
"This log provides a list of issues identified during data collection or processing, prior to publication"
"of this data package. For a more recent log, please visit this data product's detail page at"
"https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.30012.001."
"Issue Date: 2023-05-09"
"Issue: D01 state-level taxa obfuscation: Prior to the 2024 data release, publication of species identifications were obfuscated to a higher taxonomic rank when the taxon was found to be listed as threatened, endangered, or sensitive by any state within the domain. Obfuscating state-listed taxa across an entire domain has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity."
"    Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2023-04-25"
"    Location(s) Affected: D01"
"Resolution Date: 2023-12-31"
"Resolution: To reduce the number of records in which taxonomic identifications are obfuscated in D01, the state-level obfuscation routine has been applied to data using site-level granularity as of 25 April 2023. Previously published data have been reprocessed using the more precise obfuscation routine for the 2024 data release and onward. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites."
"Issue Date: 2022-09-15"
"Issue: Direct URLs to data in large file storage are different in RELEASE-2021 and RELEASE-2022 than in later releases and provisional data."
"    Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2020-12-31"
"    Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2022-04-12"
"Resolution: NEON data storage was migrated to a new system in early 2022. URLs in the downloadFileUrl field begin with https://s3.data.neonscience.org in RELEASE-2021 and RELEASE-2022. In subsequent releases and provisional data, URLs begin with https://storage.neonscience.org . The earlier URLs remain usable and automatically redirect to the current data location. Data contents are identical between the old and new storage system for files with the same name; if data and file names have been updated in subsequent releases, it is due to specific data corrections and quality improvements, not to the storage system."
"Issue Date: 2021-12-09"
"Issue: Prior to the 2022 data release, publication of species identifications were obfuscated to a higher taxonomic rank when the taxon was found to be listed as threatened, endangered, or sensitive at the state level where the observation was recorded. Obfuscating state-listed taxa has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity."
"    Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2021-12-31"
"    Location(s) Affected: All"
"Resolution Date: 2021-12-31"
"Resolution: The state-level obfuscation routine was removed from the data publication process at all locations excluding sites located in D01 and D20. Data have been reprocessed to remove the obfuscation of state-listed taxa. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites and sensitive species remain redacted at National Park sites."
"ADDITIONAL INFORMATION"
"----------------------"
"Full documentation for this data product is currently under development. A Data Product User Guide is available now, which gives the basic overview, and an Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document will be available in spring 2021."
"NEON DATA POLICY AND CITATION GUIDELINES"
"----------------------------------------"
"A citation statement is available in this data product's detail page at"
"https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.30012.001. Please visit https://www.neonscience.org/data-policy for"
"more information about NEON's data policy and citation guidelines."
"DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING"
"---------------------------"
"NEON data are initially published with a status of Provisional, in which updates to data and/or processing"
"algorithms will occur on an as-needed basis, and query reproducibility cannot be guaranteed. Once data are published"
"as part of a Data Release, they are no longer provisional, and are associated with a stable DOI."
"To learn more about provisional versus released data, please visit"
"https://www.neonscience.org/data-revisions-releases."
