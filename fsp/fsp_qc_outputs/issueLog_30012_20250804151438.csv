Obfuscating state-listed taxa has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity.","The state-level obfuscation routine was removed from the data publication process at all locations excluding sites located in D01 and D20. Data have been reprocessed to remove the obfuscation of state-listed taxa. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites and sensitive species remain redacted at National Park sites."

URLs in the downloadFileUrl field begin with https://s3.data.neonscience.org in RELEASE-2021 and RELEASE-2022. In subsequent releases and provisional data, URLs begin with https://storage.neonscience.org . The earlier URLs remain usable and automatically redirect to the current data location. Data contents are identical between the old and new storage system for files with the same name; if data and file names have been updated in subsequent releases, it is due to specific data corrections and quality improvements, not to the storage system."

Obfuscating state-listed taxa across an entire domain has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity.","To reduce the number of records in which taxonomic identifications are obfuscated in D01, the state-level obfuscation routine has been applied to data using site-level granularity as of 25 April 2023. Previously published data have been reprocessed using the more precise obfuscation routine for the 2024 data release and onward. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites."
